Pretend heroics aren't much protection from bullies and social ridicule, however, and ultimately his worried family was forced to transfer him to a new school. Now determined to follow a different path and fit in, Ichirou thought he'd managed to give up his old fantasies. Until he encountered Ryouko Satou, who's even more deeply immersed in her own imaginary world than Ichirou was. And bullied just as cruelly for it. If he stands up for Ryouko, Ichirou could destroy the new life he's trying to build.

And, in the end, it may just be that the only one who can really rescue this damsel in distress is the dream hero that Ichirou thought he had buried forever in AURA.","{'School Life', 'Drama', 'Based on a Light Novel', 'Romance', 'Transfer Students'}","{'Bullying,', 'Nudity'}"
