# Anime Rating Prediction SC1015 Mini Project

## About
This project aims to predict the quality (rating) of anime based on tags (genres) using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, consisting of web-scraped data from animeplanet.com. We explore the correlation between tags and ratings to enhance the recommendation system for anime enthusiasts.

## Problem Definition
The main objective of this project is to investigate whether tags (genres) can be used to predict the quality (rating) of anime. By understanding the relationship between tags and ratings, we aim to improve the accuracy of anime recommendations for viewers.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Other transformations on the response variable (quantile, log, square root)

## Conclusion
Through this project, we have explored various machine learning techniques to predict anime ratings based on tags. Our Random Forest Regression model outperformed other models, demonstrating promising results in predicting anime ratings.
